# Friend Finder - Find a compatible buddy!

### Overview

Friend Finder is an application that takes user input in the form of a survey and compares it to existing users in a pre-defined array.  The closest match is then displayed.

The NPM module express is used for routing of pages and api calls.

    - node_modules

    - server.js
  ```
### Requirements

1. The survey has 10 questions. Each response is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

2. `server.js` file requirea the npm packages: `express` and `path`.

3. `htmlRoutes.js` two routes:

   * GET Route to `/survey` which goes to survey.html.
   * Catch-all route that goes to `home.html`.

4. Your `apiRoutes.js` file should contain two routes:

   * A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
   * A POST routes `/api/friends`. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.

5. You should save your application's data inside of `app/data/friends.js` as an array of objects. Each of these objects should roughly follow the format below.

```json
{
  "name":"Ahmed",
  "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
  "scores":[
      5,
      1,
      4,
      4,
      5,
      1,
      2,
      5,
      4,
      1
    ]
}
```

6. Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:

   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example:
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on.
   * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

7. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
